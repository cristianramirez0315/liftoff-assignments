### Overview
Actual footage of me pitching you an app! Haha but in a serious note,
aren’t you tired of seeing the same old meme over and over again.
Well your days of repetitive memes are over! Introducing “Meme Wars!” You heard that right!

Post, share and rank memes. Simply upvote or downvote memes as “good” or “bad” or get
creative and let them know that we have all “seen it” and it’s not funny anymore or
that it’s #relatable. Let the war begin!

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.
Create Post: Users will be able to create new meme posts when logged in.
Vote on a meme: Pick between multiple good or bad choices (funny, relatable, new, bad, confusing, old).
Leaderboards: Page where a user can see all the good and bad memes ranked. And also the best meme lord.
// nice to have
Search by hashtag: When a user posts a meme they can tag it. And anyone can search by hashtag.
